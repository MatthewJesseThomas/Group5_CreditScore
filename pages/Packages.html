                Bad Credit Means Trouble Getting a Loan! <br>
            A low score can make it harder to borrow, whether it's a car loan, mortgage, or credit card account. And if you do qualify, you'll likely have to pay higher interest rates to make up for your great level of default risk. <br>
            </h3>
            <h2>•How we may Help•</h2> <br>
            <h3>To fix a bad credit score, understand the basic contributors to credit—including whether you pay your bills on time and whether you carry balances on credit cards—and identify the factors that are making a negative impact. Checking for errors on your credit report is also an important step.

            Your credit score is a three-digit number, usually between 300 and 850, that's based on the information in your credit report. It's valuable for lenders, who need to understand how likely you are to repay money you borrow.
            
            While there are several credit scoring models with different score ranges, 700 or higher is generally considered a good credit score, while 800 or higher is excellent. If your score isn't quite in that range, here's how to get it back in shape.

                Fair Credit Means! <br>
                FICO® considers a fair credit score to be between 580 and 669. VantageScore® says fair scores fall between 601 and 660. <br>
            </h3>

            <h3>Is a fair credit score average?
                A fair credit score is sometimes referred to as “having average credit.” However, this only means that people with fair credit, which includes anyone with a FICO score between 580 and 669, fall in the middle of the credit score ranges. It does not mean that the average South African has a fair credit score.
                
                Currently, FICO credit scores start at 300 points and run all the way to 850 points. In 2021, the average FICO credit score was 716 points, which means that the average South African had good credit, not fair credit.
                
                If you have fair credit, your credit score is neither good nor bad. It’s somewhere in between, which is why a fair credit score is often described as “average.”
            <br>
                •What cards can I apply for with fair credit• <br>
                While many of the top Credit cards are only available to people with good or excellent credit, there are still many worthwhile credit cards for people with fair credit.
                
                You can improve your credit score, and with responsible use you’ll be automatically considered for a higher credit after six months of card ownership.
